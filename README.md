# DaiLiDos
Thoughts. Points. Ideas. Renditions. Excerpts. Analyses. Et Cetera.
Hello, I'm Dai-Li. I want to share with you. Facts and information, imagery and nuance, abstract, analytical, contraversial, surprising, calming, and simply ordinary things. There's so much to learn, so much to remember, so much to forgert, so much to appreciate, and so much to be completely enamored by. I want to share with you. I still believe that sharing is caring and while, honestly, some things I can care less for, the human experience and our existential values are what I care most about. So I'd love to engage you and bring you into my world of thoughtful dualities. Good or bad, light or dark, evil and totally wicked (in a good way) - I want to bring you in and share with you, the care I have for you.
